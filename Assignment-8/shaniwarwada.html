    <dd>The remnants include a fortification wall enclosing the complex, the gates, and some parts of the actual palace. Another attractive architectural marvel here is the fountain, shaped like a lotus flower. The influence of Mughal architecture in its design can be seen in many places. And you can get a glimpse into the original structure at the centre of the fort.

A 21-feet tall door acts as the main entrance, where a majestic statue of Bajirao welcomes you. The fort also has other gates – Dilli Darwaza, Ganesh Darwaza and Mastani Darwaza.

It’s among the top historical places to visit in Pune</dd>
    <dt>History</dt>
    <dd>Shaniwar Wada, the seat of the Maratha empire from 1730 to 1818, is in the heart of Pune. It was built by Bajirao Peshwa as a residence for the Peshwas. And it displays the architectural prowess of the Maratha artisans.

It has a very important place in Indian history. But because of multiple military attacks and fire, the fort has been nearly destroyed over the years. What remains of it, though, is still majestic.
